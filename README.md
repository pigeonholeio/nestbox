## 🏗️ Architecture

### The Security Model

**What happens on your device stays on your device.**

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript |
| **Build** | Vite (next-gen tooling) |
| **UI** | Material-UI v7 |
| **State** | Zustand (lightweight & fast) |
| **Crypto** | OpenPGP.js (battle-tested) |

## 📖 How It Works

### Sending a Secret

1. **Upload** files via drag-and-drop or file picker
2. **Add** recipient email addresses (max 3)
3. **Configure** expiration time and options
4. **Click** Send — and watch the magic happen
5. **Share** Your recipient receives a notification

### Receiving a Secret

1. Navigate to **Receive Secrets**
2. See all secrets sent to you
3. **Download** one (downloads encrypted)
4. **Decrypt** automatically with your private key
5. **Extract** and use your files
6. If it was a one-time secret, it's already gone

### Multi-Account Support

Store keys for multiple identities. Switch between accounts instantly. Your keys stay encrypted in localStorage — only decrypted when you need them.

## 🔒 Security Highlights

### Key Storage
- Private keys encrypted with **AES-GCM**
- Stored in **localStorage** (never transmitted)
- **Per-email-address** encryption keys
- Keys **never leave your browser**

**Requires:** Web Crypto API, localStorage, ES2020 JavaScript

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Key generation failed" | Browser may not support Web Crypto API. Try a modern browser or clear localStorage. |
| "Token exchange failed" | Verify Auth0 Client ID and API base URL. Check browser console. |
| "User not found" | Recipient may not have a PigeonHole account. Use Transient Key option. |
| "Decryption failed" | Secret may be encrypted for a different key. Try signing out and back in. |
